### Codewars 7 kyu kata

**Kata descriprion:**

> Oh no!  
> Some really funny web dev gave you a sequence of numbers from his API response as an sequence of strings!  
> You need to cast the whole array to the correct type.  
> Create the function that takes as a parameter a sequence of numbers represented as strings and outputs a sequence of numbers.  
> ie:["1", "2", "3"] to [1, 2, 3]  
> Note that you can receive floats as well.

**My solution:**

```
function toNumberArray(stringarray) {
  return stringarray.map(parseFloat);
}

toNumberArray(["1", "2", "3"]);
```
